[{"content":"An introduction into who I am, where my experiences and passions lie, and what the purpose of this blog is.\nHumble Beginnings tl;dr\nI like to think that my life truly began when I came to Austin, TX in the 6th grade. It was such a big change from what I had been to used to, having lived my whole life prior in the likes of Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi. My middle school experience wasn’t really all that memorable though—with the main highlights including lots of video games played and my involvement in the production of my 7th and 8th-grade yearbooks.\nHowever, it was during this mundane middle school experience that I was introduced to the world of software. Having stumbled upon a simple, frontend graphics library called Processing.js in my tech-systems class, I became infatuated with coding. I was in awe as to what I was able to create all on my own, as a small, frail, pakistani boy. The remainder of my eighth grade from that point on was filled with many sleepless nights spent coding away.\nMy freshman year, I signed up for AP Computer Science, an intro to CS class taught in Java. With my previous coding experience (Pygame and Processing.js—insane I know), I breezed through the class and got a fi—three on the AP Exam\u0026hellip; Don\u0026rsquo;t worry I re-took it the next year and got that five. Speaking of the next year: over the Spring break of my sophomore year, I attended my first Hackathon. And guess what was the first-place prize: an internship at a local cybersecurity startup called Threatcare (now merged with ReliaQuest). And guess who\u0026rsquo;s team got first place: not mine! However, through some persistence and persuasion, I convinced the CEO of the startup to (pity) grant me an internship position at his company.\nNow, this may not have been my dream \u0026ldquo;software engineering internship\u0026rdquo;, jam-packed with writing production code and working with a professional dev team, but it was definitely a turning point in my life. It was during this summer that I finally realized that coding could be a profession, and that I wanted everything to do with it.\nNearing the end of this internship, I was spending some time in downtown Austin when rain started coming down from nowhere. Seeking shelter, I hurried to a nearby event center. As I walked in through the 30-foot-tall doors, I saw a man in a blue polo reading a book, sitting behind a table with a sign that read \u0026ldquo;Check-in\u0026rdquo;. I asked him what he was doing and his response was, \u0026ldquo;well, I work for a company called Auction Source and we\u0026rsquo;re helping XYZ organization run this event today.\u0026rdquo; Being the incredibly bold 16-year-old I was at the time, I asked if they were hiring. Not if they were hiring software engineers, or part-timers, or interns: just if they were hiring. But just as luck would have it, there comes swooping in the VP of the company, bringing with him a very welcoming, \u0026ldquo;hell yeah we are!\u0026quot;—and his business card.\nAfter a pair of phone interviews and one of the in-person variety, I was hired on a part-time/contractor basis as a \u0026ldquo;technician.\u0026rdquo; My job was to arrive at a customer\u0026rsquo;s (most often a charity organization) event with a boatload of MacBooks and iPads in tow, set up a registration area, and teach their staff/volunteers how to use our platform. Then throughout the night, my role was more aligned with damage control—meaning that during a perfect event I would barely move a muscle until the end of the night. Thankfully, there were no \u0026ldquo;perfect events.\u0026rdquo;\nA little something about me is that I am not the most—you know—\u0026ldquo;academically driven\u0026rdquo; individual. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t do homework if I thought it was pointless, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t study for a quiz or test if I didn\u0026rsquo;t find the topics interesting. My typical day in high school would comprise of waking up late, driving 40 minutes to school (I lived outside of the school district), showing up tardy to first period (by more than a little), messing around with my friends, or coding whenever I could do so without being scolded (most of the time), and then leaving an hour or two early to go to work. If I didn\u0026rsquo;t have work that day then I would drive 40 minutes back home through traffic, code until around dinner time, go to the gym with my buddies, and then come home and code until 2 or 3 in the morning. Just in-case you missed it, \u0026ldquo;study\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;do homework\u0026rdquo; weren\u0026rsquo;t anywhere to be found in this daily routine, and \u0026ldquo;go to class\u0026rdquo; was more of a suggestion.\nSince we\u0026rsquo;re around 1000 words in, let\u0026rsquo;s take a little recap. At this part of my journey, I\u0026rsquo;ve: interned at a software company, been working part-time for about 9 months at another, taken 2 CS classes, and worked on a few personal projects; but I knew it was time for the big leagues. One weekend, a local high school had come to us asking for our services at their upcoming annual fundraiser. I called dibs and later that week I drove up to the venue for the event. The job starts off pretty standard: set up the check-in area, train the volunteers, etc. A couple of hours into the night, once the majority of the constituents were already 3-4 drinks in, I\u0026rsquo;m biding my time until the end of the night when a man in his mid-forties asks me about the platform we were using and what technologies were in action. Like the genius I am, I told him it was a \u0026ldquo;Java front-end and Angular backend.\u0026rdquo; For those who are less developer-savy, that\u0026rsquo;s the equivalent of me saying \u0026ldquo;my shoes are made of the finest silk and my garbs, snake leather!\u0026rdquo; After quite the strong start though, we sat down and had a conversation. He tells me that he works for a local healthcare-software company. Near the end of the conversation, I ask him if the company hired software engineer interns. After sizing me up, he makes the mista—I mean he tells me that they indeed do and gave me the email of their \u0026ldquo;College Talent Recruiter\u0026rdquo;.\nAfter a couple of months and a phone interview, I\u0026rsquo;m invited to the office for a Technical Interview. So, in the usual fashion, I leave school early and show-up to their office with hutzpah and vigor. There were two interviewers: the first was a Sr. Software Architect and the other was the Head of QA. The first part of the interview was pretty basic: tell us about yourself, walk us through some of your projects, etc. Now onto the second part, the coding question: Write a binary search tree sorting algorithm. Literally, 4 hours prior, my high school CS teacher, when asked about how to prepare for a technical interview, told me that the most common question asked either was about or involved, a binary search tree. So, like any reasonable person, I studied them the day before the interview. However, I had one small shortcoming: I didn\u0026rsquo;t know that all the studying in the world would be rendered useless if you blank the day of.\nSo after bombing the technical portion of the interview, the two interviewers sat me down and told me that they really liked me and asked my opinion of working with the QA team. I stated no objections and 2 months later, I got an email congratulating me on landing the position, along with a DocuSign contract for a 12-week, $20/hr internship. I would be starting at the end of May as a software engineer intern at Iodine Software. After (flexing on) telling every single person I knew about my smexy new internship and spending every hour between then and May learning Maven, JUnit, and Selenium WebDriver, I was ready for the big leagues.\nAlright, it\u0026rsquo;s the big day, the first day of my big boy software engineering internship. After getting settled into my work station and meeting everyone at the company who I was allowed to be on speaking terms with (just kidding), I was given my first assignment: refactor the QA codebase. Now, I want to preface that at this point in time, I didn\u0026rsquo;t even know what the word \u0026ldquo;refactor\u0026rdquo; meant, what the importance of a clean codebase was, or anything other than fundamental computer science constructs and basic back-end development. So the first thing I asked after seeing an absolute mess of a codebase was, \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s wrong with it? Looks fine to me.\u0026rdquo; So the head of QA sat me down and explained to me why this codebase was an intertangled monstrosity of a repository and needed heavy cleaning. Essentially, the codebase comprised of one repository containing every single integration test written for each of all 3 of the companies products. They were all under the same Maven project, had no versioning system, had minimal CI, and were impossible to work on unless you knew exactly what you were doing. The goal was to split them up into their own projects and have them work independently of one another.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;ve got my first big project and I\u0026rsquo;m ready to go. After spending the first week getting the test suite and all of the company\u0026rsquo;s products to run locally, I was ready to knock this assignment out of the park! Now looking back, it\u0026rsquo;s clear as day that this project would take at least a couple of weeks to be able to tango with the behemoth and carefully pull it apart; but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t the most experienced developer at the time. I told my boss—verbatim: \u0026ldquo;Ok cool, I should have this done by next week.\u0026rdquo; I said it with so much confidence that he believed me without any supportive reasoning whatsoever. His response: \u0026ldquo;Great, good luck!\u0026rdquo;\nNow the reason I thought this would take me a week was because I thought he was giving me some intern busy work. I thought that my entire job was to literally drag and drop the files in the repo into three different folders. Now you may have guessed that I had a bit of a rude awakening. So, the end of the week rolls around and my boss asks for a progress update\u0026hellip;there was no progress. Thankfully he half-expected this and gave me a pretty general run-down of what I needed to do. So, for the next 5-6 weeks, I learned how to use: Maven, JUnit, Selenium, BitBucket, Bamboo, and Artifactory. I split the codebase into 3 different repos, with one being a general library used by the other 2, version-controlled and deployed to Artifactory. I also set up the other two repos with Bamboo and Artifactory so that they could be seamlessly deployed. Now, after my 1 week project had taken over half of the duration my internship, I had a bit of a realization.\nI might not be some genius developer. Now, don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong. I\u0026rsquo;m a quick learner and my love for the field helps me write amazing code. But back then, I thought I was the shit. I thought I was this child prodigy developer that knows everything and could start working full-time whenever I felt like it. There were simply so many unknown unknowns that I thought I knew everything. This project was such an amazing wake-up call for me and changed how I viewed myself as a developer. I even sat down with my manager and told him, \u0026ldquo;I thought I was this rockstar developer who could take over the world, but I\u0026rsquo;m barely a novice. How can I become an amazing software engineer?\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;ll save what he told me for a different post, but now I knew that I had some work ahead of me: and this made me feel so exhilarated. From that point forward, I\u0026rsquo;ve always been so excited to become a better developer and each step along the way has been incredibly rewarding.\nMy next couple of assignments were a bit more sporadic: fix some CSS here, write some integration tests there. One of the cooler ones was to implement this technology called Swagger to automatically document, create a library for, and deploy one of our APIs. There were also a bunch of fun, non-coding things that happened. From weekly lunches hosted (and paid for) by the admin team to a go-karting event at the Circuit of the Americas track, there was no end to the fun I had when I wasn\u0026rsquo;t coding. This internship was one of the most enjoyable times in my life and that summer is one that I\u0026rsquo;ll never forget for the rest of my life.\nSadly, once the internship ended, I had to go back to school for my final year as a high school student. The beginning of the year started off with college apps. I applied to 8 schools. Seven rejections. Now I go to A\u0026amp;M. At first, I was a little disappointed. I thought I\u0026rsquo;d be going to Carnegie Mellon, UIUC, or at least UT. I think the main reason I wasn\u0026rsquo;t admitted was that my grades were\u0026hellip;less than ideal. I guess skipping class to work part-time at a software company is no bueno. Regardless, I don\u0026rsquo;t regret it. I enjoyed my time in high school and I love A\u0026amp;M.\nThe remainder of the school year was pretty unnoteworthy. I was elected as the \u0026ldquo;Araneator\u0026rdquo; or web-master of my high school Latin club. Here\u0026rsquo;s the site! I went to the gym every day so now I\u0026rsquo;m super jacked. The company that I had been working at for the past two years shut-down due to the pandemic. I worked on a couple of software projects here and there. And I confessed my feelings to the girl that I had liked for the past 3 years: did not go well. But jokes on her—now I write a blog on the internet that no one reads\u0026hellip;\nSadly, due to the pandemic, I was unable to do the one thing I had been looking forward to the most for the whole year: take part in another internship. But I found a better use of my time: all 300 episodes of Gintama :). I also worked on a small web app with a couple of my friends: you can find the repo here. Near the end of the summer, I had to take a Math Placement Exam for A\u0026amp;M. Fun fact: I stopped taking math classes my sophomore year of high school when I suffered through Algebra II, not because of how hard it was, but because of how bored I was in it. So you could say that I was pretty scared about how I would do. However, after a couple of dozen hours of Khanacademy and two-or-three practice tests, I got a 30/33. I needed a 22/30 to be placed in Calculus I, which was my goal. Lesson of the day: don\u0026rsquo;t over prepare.\nA couple of weeks after the MPE debacle, I moved into my dorm at A\u0026amp;M as a general engineering student. I took a pretty easy course-load my first semester and finished with a 3.5. During the school year, I spent most of my time hanging out with my friends, working at the newest company on the list: Code Galaxy, as a coding instructor for elementary-through-high-school students, applying to internships, and hating myself—but I\u0026rsquo;ll save that story for another post. I played on the club tennis team and for a brief period of time, was part of the dev team for an A\u0026amp;M student-led project called RevRegistration. Near the end of the semester, I met a cute girl in the laundry room and we started dating. And during the Winter Break following my first (successful) semester at A\u0026amp;M, I\u0026rsquo;m starting this blog!\ntl;dr I moved to Austin when I was in the 6th grade and started coding two years later. I took AP Computer Science all four of my years in high school, as well as way too many other AP classes. The summer following my sophomore year, I landed my first internship at a cybersecurity company in downtown Austin called Threatcare. I got this internship through a hackathon I had attended a few months prior. The next summer, I interned at a mid-sized healthcare-software company called Iodine Software. I spent my senior year like most others: coding until 3 am on most days and getting rejected from all but one of the colleges I applied to: A\u0026amp;M. And after a pretty successful first semester at A\u0026amp;M, I\u0026rsquo;m writing this post over winter break!\n Interests and Expertise Let\u0026rsquo;s start with what I\u0026rsquo;m interested in. As you can probably tell from my Humble Beginnings, I love to code. I find it amazing how much of an impact one developer can make, and how quickly they can accrue the needed skills. I\u0026rsquo;ve also always had a great interest in self-improvement and productivity. I\u0026rsquo;m always looking for ways to better myself and I\u0026rsquo;ve scoured the internet far and wide for methods of doing so. I\u0026rsquo;ve also recently taken an interest in Entreprenuership, and hope to take you all along that ride very soon!\nIn terms of expertise, I\u0026rsquo;ve been coding for the past 5 years. My favorite technologies include: Python, JavaScript, Node, Vue, MySQL, and Go. Since I\u0026rsquo;m (eternally) only a freshman in college, my academic knowledge is somewhat limited: comprising of basic Calculus, Statistics, (Organic) Chemistry, Latin (for some reason), and Computer Science. I\u0026rsquo;m currently majoring in CS, as well as pursuing minors in Psychology and Business.\n Goal of this Blog Now, you may be asking yourself, \u0026ldquo;Why is this dude writing a blog?\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;What can I, as a reader, get out of this?\u0026rdquo;. To answer the former, I feel as though I, through all of my life experiences, have some two-sense or piece of wisdom that at least one person out there could learn and better their life from. To answer the latter: I\u0026rsquo;ve experienced many hardships in the areas of software engineering, self-development, motivation, and productivity, and have learned many hard lessons in each. So as to save you time so that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to crawl through the same trenches I did, I wish to share the lessons I\u0026rsquo;ve learned throughout my life, via this blog.\n","permalink":"/posts/about-me/","summary":"\u003c!-- raw HTML omitted --\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAn introduction into who I am, where my experiences and passions lie, and what the purpose of this blog is.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","title":"About Me"},{"content":"My personal strategy and tactics on how to stay motivated.\nA Leaky Bucket This is how I like to think of motivation. It\u0026rsquo;s something you can add to, but slowly leaks as time goes on. Now, with every leaky bucket, there are two solutions—well, kinda. One option would be to add water very quickly to our bucket. If we add water faster than it can leak out, then problem solved, right? Well, how about we look at our second option. Instead of just avoiding the inevitable by continuing to fill the bucket, what if we instead tried to fix the cracks in the walls? This way, we won\u0026rsquo;t be wasting as much water, and we won\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about filling our bucket as quickly.\nI think what happens to most people is that when looking to \u0026ldquo;regain motivation\u0026rdquo;, the try to just refill their bucket very quickly. Although this may work in the short-term, it becomes unsustainable in the long-run. That is why I consider this a fix, not a solution—because it does not solve the underlying issue.\nIt turns out that these holes in our bucket are shared by most people. Although everyone\u0026rsquo;s bucket may not look the same, these small cracks have similarities among everyone.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t Get Burnt Out In my opinion, the number 1 \u0026ldquo;demotivator\u0026rdquo; or largest crack in most people\u0026rsquo;s buckets comes from getting burnt out. I\u0026rsquo;ve got a whole post where I discuss ways to avoid burnout, but let me give you a quick run through of the three main tactics for avoiding burnout.\nThe first is to spend as much time as possible in a flow state. This will help you maximize not only productivity, but also enjoyment while working. A flow state can be achieved only when distractions are completely absent and there is a proper balance between the skill of the doer and the difficulty of the thing being done.\nThe second is to be realistic with your goals (obv if you don\u0026rsquo;t have any goals to begin with, this is an even bigger problem). Challenging but attainable and well spaced-out goals are like speed boosts in any well made racing game—they keep you engaged and make you feel like you\u0026rsquo;re on psychedelics!\nThe final principle is to stay patient. All good things come with time, and \u0026ldquo;there is no such thing as something for nothing\u0026rdquo; - Napoleon Hill, Think and Grow Rich.\nHigh Quality People Everything you consume has a major impact on your life. What you eat, how you entertain yourself, and most importantly, who you spend your time with. Surrounding yourself with high quality people is just as, if not more important, than eating right, exercising regularly, and not letting your kids watch R-rated movies when they\u0026rsquo;re 16 and a half.\nSeriously though, if you\u0026rsquo;re surround with motivated people or people who you look up to, you\u0026rsquo;re gonna be a hell-of-a-lot more motivated than Joe Shmo who spends all his time with crackheads and 16-and-a-half-year-olds who sneak into R-rated movies at the movie theater.\nDo what you love (I know) The age-old advice. One day, I was sitting at my desk, wondering why I wasn\u0026rsquo;t motivated to write a certain AP World History essay. Then it hit me—I hate writing AP World History essays. The rest of the story doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter (partly because I got a 37 on the paper), but this really changed my expectations around motivation. How could I expect myself to be motivated to do something I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to? Don\u0026rsquo;t beat yourself up over not being motivated to do something you don\u0026rsquo;t want to—we\u0026rsquo;re just not built like that. However, it\u0026rsquo;s always important to look at the bigger picture. A good friend of mine once told me, \u0026ldquo;you must get past the bad suck, to get the good suck.\u0026rdquo;\nThink Long Term—All the Time! I briefly touched on setting goals and thinking about the bigger picture, but I want to emphasize why these things are so critical to staying motivated. Setting goals is a must. No one goes to the grocery store because they like going to the grocery store. People go to the grocery store so they can make a nice dinner for their family or so that they can enjoy a couple of beers and some bean dip with the bois while watching the game. Unless you\u0026rsquo;re just absolutely infatuated with the act of breathing, you\u0026rsquo;re going to need some solid long term goals to get you through some of the shittier things in life. No one wants to wait 20 minutes in line at Starbucks, but it\u0026rsquo;s way better than a divorce :)\nJust Stay Motivated, Duh! And those are my (wise) opinions on staying motivated! I hope you found any (or all) of it helpful and I\u0026rsquo;d love to hear some feedback in the comment section that I haven\u0026rsquo;t implemented yet!\n","permalink":"/posts/how-to-stay-motivated/","summary":"\u003c!-- raw HTML omitted --\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eMy personal strategy and tactics on how to stay motivated.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","title":"How To Stay Motivated"},{"content":"My analysis and takeaways from Dale Carnegie\u0026rsquo;s, \u0026ldquo;How to Win Friends and Influence People\u0026rdquo;.\nIf You\u0026rsquo;ve Never Read the Book Then go and read it. I\u0026rsquo;m not going to sit here and tell you that I can convey the messages from the book better than Dale Carnegie himself. However, if you would like just a morsel of the knowledge that is available in this masterpiece, then I will do best.\nOverview No book has had more of a grand or lasting impact on how I go about my everyday life than the absolute classic that is How to Win Friends and Influence People. I consider it the bible on social interaction and mentality when it comes to interpersonal communication. I\u0026rsquo;ve re-read the books multiples times and implement lessons taught in it almost daily. I attribute the majority of the success (haha) when communicating to what I\u0026rsquo;ve learned by reading this book. After an incredibly poor interaction with another person—like getting into a fight with my dad or feeling terrible after a conversation—I\u0026rsquo;ll re-read anything I\u0026rsquo;ve highlighted in the book and think of ways I could\u0026rsquo;ve handled the situation better. Now, let us explore some of what are in my opinion the most important lessons from the book.\nMy Main Takeaways Don\u0026rsquo;t Criticize, Condemn, or Complain The reason I\u0026rsquo;ve started with this lesson from the book is because it\u0026rsquo;s the one I have the most trouble staying true to. As someone who has always kept high standards and expectations for myself, I have a tendency to allow these things to spill over onto others. This isn\u0026rsquo;t because I hate people or I think that I\u0026rsquo;m better than everyone else; it\u0026rsquo;s actually the exact opposite. If I care deeply about someone else, I want to do everything I can to make them happy. This often manifests in me giving the other person lots of \u0026ldquo;constructive criticism\u0026rdquo; so that they can better themselves and lead happy lives. This approach, however, is fundamentally flawed. Carnegie offers multiple reasons why criticism is counter-productive, but here are the one\u0026rsquo;s I like the most:\n Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself. Criticism is dangerous, because it wounds a person’s precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses resentment.\n  When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.\n  Do you know someone you would like to change and regulate and improve? Good! That is fine. I am all in favor of it. But why not begin on yourself?\n Ok, now let\u0026rsquo;s try and tie these three things together. In the first quote, Carnegie articulates that criticism is \u0026ldquo;futile\u0026rdquo; because it causes others to become defensive and feel hurt. Now, at first glace, you might be skeptical. \u0026ldquo;What do you mean—I take criticism super well!\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;But constructive criticism is OK because it has good intentions behind it\u0026rdquo; might be your initial response. In that case, let\u0026rsquo;s continue to the second quote, where the author said something that completely changed the way I interact with people—and that is that people are not \u0026ldquo;creatures of logic.\u0026rdquo;\nThe human mind will do whatever it takes to produce dopamine, because that\u0026rsquo;s it\u0026rsquo;s way of giving you incentive to stay alive. This is why our minds are constantly tricking us into things like \u0026ldquo;wishful thinking\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;ignorant bliss\u0026rdquo;—to keep that dopamine flowing and keep us away from any negative emotions. What does this all mean? It means that even the most well intentioned, logical and well articulated pieces of constructive criticism should be avoided like a tall glass of OJ after brushing your teeth. This is because that even this \u0026ldquo;optimal\u0026rdquo; form of criticism can still cause others to become defensive or hurt, effectively accomplishing the opposite of your original goal and often eliciting criticism in return. So, before you think to criticize another, redirect that mental energy and think: \u0026ldquo;how can I better myself?\u0026rdquo;\nI will add this one caveat though: if someone comes to you asking for criticism, and you think that they earnestly want to improve themselves and are emotionally able to handle it, then it may be an option. Also, in the case of close friends or family, criticism may also have a place, but I will warn you—tread extremely lightly.\nGive Honest and Sincere Appreciation I\u0026rsquo;m just going to drop some of my favorite quotes from the book relating to our next lesson, so I hope you enjoy them just as much as I do! :)\n I once succumbed to the fad of fasting and went for six days and nights without eating. It wasn’t difficult. I was less hungry at the end of the sixth day than I was at the end of the second. Yet I know, as you know, people who would think they had committed a crime if they let their families or employees go for six days without food; but they will let them go for six days, and six weeks, and sometimes sixty years without giving them the hearty appreciation that they crave almost as much as they crave food.\n  I shall pass this way but once; any good, therefore, that I can do or any kindness that I can show to any human being, let me do it now. Let me not defer nor neglect it, for I shall not pass this way again.\n  Let’s cease thinking of our accomplishments, our wants. Let’s try to figure out the other person’s good points. Then forget flattery. Give honest, sincere appreciation. Be “hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise,” and people will cherish your words and treasure them and repeat them over a lifetime—repeat them years after you have forgotten them.\n  Give honest and sincere appreciation.\n Honest and sincere appreciation. Who would\u0026rsquo;ve guessed that such a simple thing is often what people long for the most. Try to think back to a time when someone gave you a genuine compliment and how bubbly and happy it made you feel. I still, to this day, remember when someone said that I smelled nice. From that day forward, I have completely stopped using deodorant.\nSigmund Freud said that what we do comes from two motives: the sex urge and the desire to be great. Ignoring the first one, people just want to feel important. No one wants to be that one guy that no one listens to or takes seriously. We all, deep down to our core, just want to feel acknowledged. And if you can give that feeling of acknowledgement or importance to another person who\u0026rsquo;s been deprived of it for far too long, you will have given that person something of tremendous value.\nThere is no \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rdquo; in\u0026hellip;Octopus? Do you know those people who just never stop talking about themselves and couldn\u0026rsquo;t give less of a hoot about you or other people. Yeah, fuck those people. I say this knowing full well that I used to be one of them. I remember the days where I had to find some way to weasel in my two coding internships as a high school student or my super amazing girlfriend into whatever conversation I was having. No wonder people didn\u0026rsquo;t like me. The main reason for this is the sad truth that few people actually care about what you want. People have their own problems, goals, and life to deal with—they don\u0026rsquo;t have the time to think about your desires when they\u0026rsquo;re so drowned in their own. This is what the author has to say about it:\n Why talk about what we want? That is childish. Absurd. Of course, you are interested in what you want. You are eternally interested in it. But no one else is. The rest of us are just like you: we are interested in what we want.\n The only way you can get people to care about what you have to say is if you can help them get what they want. So speak to the other person\u0026rsquo;s desires. If you\u0026rsquo;re trying to influence another person to do something, don\u0026rsquo;t tell them what you want and how you are benefitting from it. Show them how you can help them achieve their desires. Back to Carnegie:\n First, arouse in the other person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way.\n The most basic principle in economics is that of supply and demand. A company makes money by satisfying a desire. So, the next time you\u0026rsquo;re trying to convince someone of something, speak in terms of their wants. Don\u0026rsquo;t make it seem like you\u0026rsquo;re selling them 6 grams of marijuana, show them how they can become happier and free.\nSmiles Save Lives/There is no Sweeter Sound than One\u0026rsquo;s Name These two things are pretty small but I wanted to include them because of how impactful they are. The first one highlights the importance of a smile. You have probably heard that just the act of smiling can make you happier. But, try to take this one step further. “There is nothing either good or bad,” said Shakespeare, “but thinking makes it so.” What the playwright is trying to convey here is the impact thoughts have on our emotions. Simply put, whether think you\u0026rsquo;re happy or sad: you\u0026rsquo;re right. If you want to be more positive and enjoy life to the fullest, start with your mind.\nThe next thing I want to highlight is the importance of remembering other\u0026rsquo;s names. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure whether it\u0026rsquo;s because I\u0026rsquo;m surrounded by college students or if it\u0026rsquo;s just been like this all along, but people are notorious for forgetting other people\u0026rsquo;s names. Especially in settings like large social gatherings or situations where you may not see the other person again, people give up on the idea of remembering the other person\u0026rsquo;s name. This is such a major loss because \u0026ldquo;a person’s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.\u0026rdquo; Putting in the effort to remember someone\u0026rsquo;s name always has an expected value of greater than zero.\nConclusion Some final things I want to include. I don\u0026rsquo;t want this to come off as me bragging or flexing about how I do all of these things super well. I can\u0026rsquo;t say with confidence that I even posses an intermediate level mastery of any of these skills. What I will say is that I recognize the importance in each one of the things that I\u0026rsquo;ve listed and I believe in earnest that if I continue to develop these skills, I will become someone I can be proud of moving forward. I truly believe that these lessons can help you do what the title of the book says they can.\nAnd that just about wraps us my favorite lessons from Dale Carnegie\u0026rsquo;s How to Win Friends and Influence People. At least the first half of it! I got you, didn\u0026rsquo;t I? Yes, these lessons are all only from the first half of the book. Stay tuned for another post outlining my thoughts on the second half of the book. But until next time, I hope you win some friends and influence some people. Oh, and please don\u0026rsquo;t sell drugs—that was purely a joke :)\n","permalink":"/posts/lessons-from-how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people/","summary":"\u003c!-- raw HTML omitted --\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eMy analysis and takeaways from Dale Carnegie\u0026rsquo;s, \u0026ldquo;How to Win Friends and Influence People\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Lessons from \"How to Win Friends and Influence People\""},{"content":"*My thoughts on the notion that you need to have a plan for the future to be successful. *\nThe Status Quo Your first day as a college student is the first day you\u0026rsquo;re no longer allowed to not know what you want to do with your life. Your decision must not only be made, but set in stone, and if it\u0026rsquo;s not: it\u0026rsquo;ll be made for you. Of course, you can always change your major or drop out of college, but if your parents aren\u0026rsquo;t white I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t recommend going back home afterwards. The whole system is so stupid. You\u0026rsquo;re forced to make a life-altering decision based on maybe 10 years of real experience in the world. The school system does a horrible job of helping you find a career path. Everyone shit talks you if you do something as crazy as changing your mind. And if you take a gap-year to find your passion before going to college, you\u0026rsquo;re seen as lesser than those who don\u0026rsquo;t. The system celebrates those who make quick and tradition decisions and punishes those who don\u0026rsquo;t want to brazenly put all their eggs into one basket. Even after college, if you want to work somewhere your degree isn\u0026rsquo;t very applicable then good luck—because a degree in gender-studies is barely better than no degree at all.\nOf course, not everyone thinks this. Some colleges force students to be undecided or general studies their first year so that they\u0026rsquo;re not stuck in a 4-year program they hate. Some companies hire people based on who they are, not the words on a piece of paper. Some people preach that you should drop out of college and do what you love: like make jam. I definitely think that people are moving away from the tradition mindset on the topic, but it\u0026rsquo;s still very prevalent. As such, I would like to express the merits and demerits of creating a long term plan, putting all your eggs into on basket, and searching for your calling in life with celerity.\nOptimism vs Realism There are two types of people, those who prefer to look at things with optimism because it makes them happier, and those who look at things with skepticism because they\u0026rsquo;re afraid of being disappointed, wasting their time, or being hurt. However, most people know that being optimistic usually leads to a happier and most successful life. So how can we apply this to the idea of having long term plans? Well, I want you, right now, to think about the ideal future. It can be 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, or 43 minutes and 18 seconds into the future. Think about what you would do on a perfect day. Think about the things that you would have, the things you would have experienced, and everything you would have accomplished up until that point. Be optimistic. Even if the chance of you passing college is below 2.3%, just imagine that you have that Supreme T-shirt anyway. Just immerse yourself in that ideal future and live in it.\nNow, I know it\u0026rsquo;s a pain, but grab a pencil, and write down 12 things you see. Half of them, for our purposes, should be related to passion or a career, and the remaining 6 should be about who you are and what the people around you are like. There are many things that you can do with this, but for today, just do me a favor and be optimistic that you can be there one day.\nKnowing What You Want in Life I have no idea what I want in life. There, I said it. That was scary. I don\u0026rsquo;t like saying that out loud—but it needed to be said. I think that I want to work on education in the future, maybe doing something with computers, possibly write book and become a speaker on the topic of productivity and other life-coaching topics. But if I was a betting man, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t put a dollar on any of those things coming true.\nRelating to the last section, it\u0026rsquo;s not that I\u0026rsquo;m being pessimistic, I\u0026rsquo;m just very aware of the sporadic nature of life. Life is a fucking whirlpool and we\u0026rsquo;re on a paper boat with only a straw to us as an oar. But as long as we have hope, we will ride the waves like a fucking 6' 8\u0026quot; viking!!! This is why I focus less on simply working on job-specific skills, but instead becoming an effective all-rounded person so that once I do find my passion, staring me down like that last pair of ripped black jeans on clearance that fit me perfectly, I will be enough of a man to grab it by the balls before someone else does.\nSo it\u0026rsquo;s okay to not know what you want in life. It, however, is not okay to stop looking and stop improving yourself (imo ofc).\nLooking Ahead So, a friend of mine got me this book recently. It\u0026rsquo;s called The Art of Impossible: A Peak Performance Primer by Steven Kotler. The book tries to create a formula for doing things that people used to consider impossible like turning a book store into a multi-billion dollar business or surfing on a wave of over 60 feet. The first section of the books goes over how to find that next \u0026ldquo;impossible\u0026rdquo; thing that\u0026rsquo;s meant for you (aka find your passion). I have not finished the book yet, but once I do, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my findings!\nConclusion So in conclusion, the system sucks. Don\u0026rsquo;t let anyone tell you where and when you have to have your life figured out. At the end the day, your happiness is the number one priority. But, if you are actively searching for that passion, just take it slow, taste everything life has to offer, explore the world and yourself, and enjoy the process! Life will reward you, I promise!\nThen, till next time, keep it fresh! I can\u0026rsquo;t wait to read about you in the news!\n","permalink":"/posts/is-it-ok-to-not-have-a-plan/","summary":"\u003c!-- raw HTML omitted --\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*My thoughts on the notion that you need to have a plan for the future to be successful. *\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Is It OK to Not Have a Plan?"},{"content":"The lessons I\u0026rsquo;ve learned during my first relationship and the changes I\u0026rsquo;ve implemented\nIntro This post may stick out a lot from what I usually write, but I wanted to write it nonetheless. In the paragraphs that follow, I will describe the major event from my first romantic relationship. Not only because my girlfriend reads this blog, but because it is something that is important for me, I will do my best to be as honest as possible. I will then go into the lessons I learned and the decisions and changes I\u0026rsquo;ve made to better myself from them.\nThe Things That Happened Romance is bittersweet—this was something I didn\u0026rsquo;t understand before I started dating her. The highs are high, and the lows are low. My whole life, I\u0026rsquo;ve look at romance like a fantasy—and at first it was. I know that all relationships are different, but I never thought that being in love would be anything other than perfect.\nOn a bright October day, I made the bold decision to actually do my laundry for once. So I gather my dirty clothes and make a 4 foot journey to the laundry room directly across the hall from my dorm room. As a walk in, I notice a girl putting her clothes in the washer. Too socially inept to look her in the eyes, I started up a conversation while focusing my vision on the buttons for cold, warm, and hot water. I asked her what she studied, to which she replied that she wanted to study civil engineering. When I inquired for the reason behind her choice of major, she responded with:\n \u0026ldquo;Because I love concrete.\u0026rdquo;\n Now, this can go one of two ways. Either she\u0026rsquo;s a class-act comedian—or—she actually likes concrete. I assumed it was the prior. It ended up being the latter. But, I speedily finished putting my clothes in the washing machine before her and said my goodbyes. As I completed my 4 foot journey back to my room, I closed my door with regret. I don\u0026rsquo;t get many strong gut feelings, but something deep inside me told me that she was special. So I went onto our floor group chat, found her GroupMe, and starting thinking of whatever excuse I could to text her. While I was engaging in the classic act of having no idea what to text her, she put a message in the floor group chat, asking the person who was hogging the dryer to please remove their clothes. I seized this opportunity to tell her that she could use my dryer once my clothes were done. Little did I know, however, that this one decision would change my life.\nA couple hours later that same day, I\u0026rsquo;m at dinner with my friends and I tell them about this girl. Being the supportive and humor driven individuals they are, I was encouraged to text her again. The only problem with this was that I\u0026rsquo;m a massive wuss, so I handed the phone to a friend of mine, who proceed to send this message,\n \u0026ldquo;How\u0026rsquo;s the concrete?\u0026rdquo;\n To which she replied,\n \u0026ldquo;Solid, very solid.\u0026rdquo;\n We exchanged a couple more texts after that and things weren\u0026rsquo;t looking too bad. While doing some homework with a friend, I asked for their opinion on how I should ask this girl out. After throwing up some ideas, we settle on ping-pong at the game room, so I hopped onto GroupMe and asked her if she was down. To my very genuine surprise, she said \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; and I met her in that game room half an hour later. We ended up stayed down there for hours, chatting and playing point after point. We talked about our interests, families, goals and dreams—I\u0026rsquo;d never had more fun talking to someone from six feet away in my entire life. Once the game room closed, I walked her back to her room and miraculously got her number (let\u0026rsquo;s go bois!).\nThat next day, I end up going back home to Austin for the weekend, but we were texting non-stop. While out to lunch with my mom at Jason\u0026rsquo;s Deli, I tell her about this girl I was talking to and bring up the topic of if I should ask her out on a date. My mom, being the amazing mother she is, convinces me I should \u0026ldquo;full-send it\u0026rdquo;—so I do. I asked her if she wanted to get happy hour sushi when I got back and she, again to my surprise, said yes.\nThe date was a amazing, and the couple of study sessions that followed were even better—it was scary how well everything was going. We\u0026rsquo;d really gotten to know each other and the connection was definitely there. One night, we went to an outdoor seating area to study for an upcoming calc test. That morning, I was feeling spunky and was listening to a self-development podcast. The episode I was listening to was about passion and the speaker recommended this activity where you write 10 things that you want. The speaker, expecting you to have written 10 things that you didn\u0026rsquo;t already posses, then asked the listener to write 20 things that they wanted, but every other item on the list must be something they already have. For example, I might write that I want a GT3 RS, and then below it write that I want a blog with 3 active readers :)\nSo I casually brought this up in conversation that night to flex my sexy self-development muscles. Turns out she actually thought it was really cool and asked me if I could show her the list. Now, I thought this might happen, so I prepared in advance by redacting 1 of the items on the list so that I still knew what it was, but she would have no idea. This was item number 3. So after we talked about some of the things I wrote down, we finished studying and started walking back to our dorm (we both live in the same hall). As we approached the final stretch, I asked her if there was anything she wanted to know about me, and promised (like a dumbass), that I would answer honestly. Within less than half of a second, she asked me what number three on the list was. This is when I had realized that I had fucked up. Now, while I may be a wuss, I\u0026rsquo;m not a bitch, so I looked her in the eyes and told her,\n Will you go out with me?\n  Holy shit, are you serious? You think I\u0026rsquo;m even the slightest bit more attracted to you than that piece of dog shit on the side walk\n —thankfully was not her response. But she told me that she had just gotten out of a relationship, and didn\u0026rsquo;t want to rush into another one. This makes total sense—this woman didn\u0026rsquo;t even know I existed until 10 days ago. But I was still over the moon. This in my mind, was a yes, and as luck would have it, two days later, it officially was.\nSo we lived happily ever after, right? Not exactly.\nI spent every waking moment I could with her. She was my best friend, and I was absolutely head-over-heels for her. We would stay up until 3AM in the lounge while she did homework and I layed on her lap, even though she had to wake up at 6:45 for work—that\u0026rsquo;s just how much we wanted to spend time together. Over the weekends we\u0026rsquo;d just sit and talk for hours or we\u0026rsquo;d hangout and watch anime until our eyes couldn\u0026rsquo;t stay open any longer. She was always on my mind, and when I wasn\u0026rsquo;t with her it felt like my coffee had just stopped hitting. I spent less time with my friends so I could be with her more. I would log on to my remote teaching job from her room just so I could be with her. After a few weeks, it felt like I had been with her for years. For our one month anniversary, I bought her a silver locket with matching earrings. A couple days later, I went to her hometown to meet her parents. A couple weeks later, I met her entire family on Black Friday. And just that next week, she met my parents and spent a couple days with me in Austin.\nWe end up going back to campus to take our finals, but all of our friends stayed home to take theirs. This meant that I could stay with her for two weeks in her dorm, essentially living with her 24/7 for that period of time: and it was great. We got to spend all day together, we got to go on fun dates all the time, minus the finals we had to take, it was heaven. She ended up coming back to Austin with me for a couple days after we finished our finals and we had a blast—but then we had to go our separate ways. At this point it was the beginning of December and winter break would be ending an entire month later. This meant that we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to see each other that often until school was back in session due to the three hour drive that separated us. It was tough. We went from seeing each other all the time, every day, to only being able to text one another, with the occasional call at night. Whenever we would talk, something seemed off, and I just didn\u0026rsquo;t know what. It seemed like she would get mad at me out of the blue, with no premonition whatsoever. Thankfully, I had a surprise in mind. My plan was to wake up a little early on Christmas morning and surprise her with her gifts in person. She liked this a lot. The next day, she drove down to Austin and spent the days before New Years with me.\nOne of these days was one I don\u0026rsquo;t think I will ever able to forget. It was a perfect Texan-winter day—blue skies and a light breeze. We slept in, had a nice lunch near where I went to high school, played 18 holes of mini golf, went to the 360 overlook during sunset, got Amy\u0026rsquo;s ice cream on the way back—everything about it was just perfect.\nBut just like the last trip, we couldn\u0026rsquo;t be with each other forever, so after a few precious days, she was on her way back home. After she left however, it felt like we we\u0026rsquo;re back to square one. We would still somehow get into arguments or I would somehow manage to upset her without even seeing her in person. After this happened as often as what felt like every other day, two weeks had passed and I was starting to get burnt out. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t understand what I was doing wrong or why she just kept getting mad at me. Then, after my mother dropped me off to campus, a few days before she was moving back in, we got into another fight—and I snapped. All I could focus on were the negatives. It felt like the relationship hadn\u0026rsquo;t produced anything positive in the past few weeks and I was tired of having to play damage control.\nSo I gave up.\n Fuck you, I\u0026rsquo;m breaking up with you.\n And just like that, I was done. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to be with her anymore. It just didn\u0026rsquo;t seem worth it. All I could see were cons and it got to the point where I couldn\u0026rsquo;t answer the question of why I was dating her.\nNow, of course we still saw each other all the time in class and around the dorm hall. And slowly, it dawned on me: I fucked up. This ended up being one of the greatest learning opportunities of my entire life. Dale Carnegie says “any fool can criticize, complain, and condemn—and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving.” I was critical, I was lacking in self control, and I was neither understanding nor forgiving. It hit me like a brick wall: I fucked up. My days from then were filled with self-reflection, regret, and lots of fucking crying.\nBut I knew I had to make it right. So I did everything I could. I apologized, I told her I was wrong, and I begged for her to take me back.\nBut she said no.\nI had betrayed her trust and said things that she could never forget. She was done with me. But I couldn\u0026rsquo;t give up. I needed a second chance to make it up to her. She had given me too much over the 5 months that we had dated, and even through our breakup. I had to be better for her. So I just kept chasing her, trying to changing her mind. But she wouldn\u0026rsquo;t budge. And I could see that every time she saw me, it hurt her more than I was okay with.\nSo I decided something. I would give her space, work on myself, and come back better.\nBut the fabled February 14th comes around, coincidentally this was exactly one month after we had broken up, and I was still working on myself. School came second, I was spending every second I had trying to be less critical, more understanding, and breaking other decade or even life-long habits. As the sun fell, I end up making a joke in our dorm floor group chat, something along the lines of \u0026ldquo;happy singles awareness day!\u0026rdquo;\nThen I open my phone, and the one app she hadn\u0026rsquo;t blocked me on notified me of a new message—from her. She apparently had seen my joke in the floor group chat and had taken it very poorly. She lashed out, telling me about how hard the past month has been for her. I ask if we could talk about it in person.\nAnd the rest, is history. That night, we get back together and at the time of me writing this, we\u0026rsquo;ve been dating for almost 7 months and have been so much better off since then. I\u0026rsquo;ve made strides in being less critical, more understanding, and more emotionally mature.\nSo, let\u0026rsquo;s go into the lessons I learned and how reading this story may be able to benefit you.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t be Critical This one is huge and I cannot emphasize this enough. Do not be critical! The best relationships aren\u0026rsquo;t the ones where both partners are perfect humans. The best relationships are built on the mutual understanding that neither one of them is perfect, and that there are so many great things about both of them! \u0026ldquo;If you look at what you have in life, you\u0026rsquo;ll always have more. If you look at what you don\u0026rsquo;t have in life, you\u0026rsquo;ll never have enough.\u0026rdquo; Oprah said that, and this is something I live by now.\nI genuinely believe that most people are amazing and that if you can look past their few shortcomings, then and only then, can you truly appreciate this fact. Before we broke up, I was so unhappy because all I could focus on were her shortcomings. But once I allowed myself to not be blinded by these shortcomings, and look further at all the amazing things about her, I was the happiest guy alive. Because she\u0026rsquo;s such an awesome person! And I owe it her, and for every single person in the world for that matter, to appreciate those things that make everyone so special.\nTransparency: Don’t be like any good CEO You know all those CEO\u0026rsquo;s that advocate for transparency? Well sadly, most of them are full of shit. Don\u0026rsquo;t be like them. Be honest. And do so early. If you truly believe something is worth brining up, then do so before it becomes a larger problem.\nKeep in mind though, if someone is bad at backgammon, it\u0026rsquo;s fine to tell them, and it\u0026rsquo;s even better if you do so before it becomes detrimental to their backgammon career, but there are many right and wrong ways to say something. And these are specific to different people, so sadly there is no one-size-fits all approach. This used to frustrate me for the longest time because I wished I could just be blunt with everyone and that it was their fault if they took it the wrong way. This is incredibly childish. People are creatures of emotion, not logic. A method I enjoy employing is presenting things not as problems, but instead avenues for growth. Or if you really need to give someone the hard truth, maybe sandwich it between a pair of complements to remind them that you still love and care for them, and that you\u0026rsquo;re not just trying to make them feel like shit.\nLife comes first This seems like a more general lesson, but it\u0026rsquo;s not selfish to prioritize yourself in a relationship. If you can\u0026rsquo;t make it to a date because you really want to go to a concert with your best friend, then no one is allowed to tell you that\u0026rsquo;s a poor decision. And although this may cause some friction in the short term, relationships where both partners become codependent on each other results in two people who are frozen in time, not taking the time and space to grow as people. This is especially important when you\u0026rsquo;re young, because youth is when most people are constantly evolving into (hopefully) better people. So don\u0026rsquo;t become attached at the hip, live your own life, and make sure you\u0026rsquo;re also not living theirs. It\u0026rsquo;s not up to you to solve their problems or give them all their time. Everyone has to scale their own walls. If you do it for them, you\u0026rsquo;re stealing their opportunity to grow.\nConclusion Sorry if that carried on for a while, this post took me a long time (like a couple months) because I wanted to make sure I had understood and grown enough from what happened to write this post. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that I\u0026rsquo;ve mastered anything I\u0026rsquo;ve listed above, or that I\u0026rsquo;m perfect by any means, but it does mean that I\u0026rsquo;ve grown considerably.\nI hope you enjoyed reading this post and I hope that this may provide you some lessons that you may be able to apply to your own life. Until next time, just keep on keepin' on! You got this, I have so much faith in you 😄\n","permalink":"/posts/what-i-learned-from-my-first-relationship/","summary":"\u003c!-- raw HTML omitted --\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe lessons I\u0026rsquo;ve learned during my first relationship and the changes I\u0026rsquo;ve implemented\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","title":"What I learned From My First Relationship"},{"content":"My advice and expertise on how to avoid burnout and keep on keepin' on!\nMy Experience with Burnout I\u0026rsquo;ve experienced burnout in a variety of activities and have generated many unfair stigma as a result. One example is my relationship with Machine Learning. Even though I know that ML is a growing field and that I\u0026rsquo;ll be directly working with it in some capacity in the future, I still get a sour look in my eye whenever it comes up in conversation. This is because the few times I\u0026rsquo;ve dabbled with it, I\u0026rsquo;ve felt like a 4 year-old trying to make a Duck Pâté en Croûte with a spoon and a lighter.\nI have the same relationship with swimming. Although I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t die without a life jacket in the middle of a kiddie pool, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be putting down hot laps back-to-back either. And by that I mean that I have to pull my head up for a few second to breath in and out when I swim instead of being able to turn my head and circulate air into my lungs—like a normal person. But because of the initial difficult I experienced when trying to learn how to swim, I never went back to put in the effort required to gain mastery in the aquatic means of mobility.\nWhy Burnout Occurs With a quick Google search, you can find this definition:\n Burnout is a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by excessive and prolonged stress. It occurs when you feel overwhelmed, emotionally drained, and unable to meet constant demands.\n So in layman\u0026rsquo;s terms, \u0026ldquo;burnout\u0026rdquo; occurs when the going gets unbearably tough and our body/mind can\u0026rsquo;t keep up. In my case, this often occurred from me metaphorically slamming my head against a wall and then eventually passing out from blood loss. I like this metaphor because it highlights what I think are the two main causes of burnout: lack of instant gratification and constant overexertion. When you make love to a wall with your forehead in a woodpecker-esque manner, not only are there no immediate signs of progress (save the blood dripping from your head), but the amount of work (not the physics kind) you\u0026rsquo;re putting in is not sustainable for a long period of time.\nMy 3 Ways of Avoiding Burnout Okay, so I\u0026rsquo;ve given you a couple examples of burnout in my life and described what I think are the two main causes, but how can we avoid burnout in our everyday lives? Before I offer my 3 ways of avoiding burnout, I want to disclaim that these are what have worked for me and that I do not have a certain piece of paper crediting everything that comes out of my mouth (figuratively) with respect to Psychology. With that in mind, let\u0026rsquo;s get right into it.\nMaintaining Flow State  In positive psychology, a flow state, also known colloquially as being in the zone, is the mental state in which a person performing some activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity.\n Sounds awesome, right? Right. In my mind, being in a flow state is the polar opposite of feeling burnt out. Instead of feeling like the task you\u0026rsquo;re working on is draining your will to live, it actually gives you the energy to keep going ad infinitum. But how do we get into this Goldilocks state of mind? Well, just like the story of the three bears, we need to find something just right. The leading theory in achieving and maintaining flow-state is to reach a balance between challenge and skill in whatever you\u0026rsquo;re doing. This means that just like the optimal pump at the gym, we do our best work when we match our level of adversity for our level of relevant skill. This way, we won\u0026rsquo;t get bored from anything being too easy, but we also won\u0026rsquo;t get tired too quickly because of anything being too difficult. I\u0026rsquo;ve provided a visual (of the highest quality) below for where the flow state lies in relation to challenge and skill.\nStaying Hypocritical As a perfectionist, I often aim for the asymptotical upper bound of what\u0026rsquo;s possible instead of a reasonable level of accomplishment. This results in me trying to optimize every minute of my day when creating a routine or getting stuck when coding a function in the pursuit of the best possible implementation. This mindset almost always leads me to destruction and it takes a lot of mental fortitude to set realistic expectations for myself, but I almost always get better results from doing the latter.\nSo before sitting down to get some work done, stay hypocritical and set realistic goals for what you want to get done. The saying \u0026ldquo;shoot for the stars—if you miss, at least you\u0026rsquo;ll hit the Moon\u0026rdquo; only applies to long term goals. Be honest with yourself in-terms of what you think you can achieve and operate under this knowledge: not a biased over- or underestimate of your ability or the task at hand.\nImplementing Patience My final method for avoiding burnout involves patience, and lots of it. Unless you\u0026rsquo;re eating a scone on a beach somewhere in Italy, instant gratification is hard to come by. Sometimes, even when we\u0026rsquo;ve perfectly balanced challenge and skill and set realistic goals for ourselves, a lack of patience causes us to sell bitcoin at only $30 a share. We all know that nothing worthwhile in life comes quickly and that success is not something that happens over night, but actually implementing these mantras in our day-to-day is hard. So just remember: even microwaveable dinners take a couple minutes before you can (and should) eat them.\nWrapping-up Our Chipotle Burrito So in conclusion, burnout is something that occurs when we the task we\u0026rsquo;re engaging in is ill-suited and we want to literally burn our eyelids off after a prolonged period of suffering. Some common examples are lifting weights that are too heavy, performing menial labor that is too simple or easy, or being dropped into the middle of the ocean without a life-vest, forced to swim 3 miles back to shore before nightfall when the sharks are on the hunt. Some ways of preventing burnout are balancing the difficulty of our task with the levels of our relevant skills, setting realistic expectations and goals before diving headfirst into a task, and waiting patiently for your labors to bear the juiciest of fruit.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s my two-sense on the topic of burning out. Hope you found it helpful :)\n","permalink":"/posts/how-to-avoid-burnout/","summary":"\u003c!-- raw HTML omitted --\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eMy advice and expertise on how to avoid burnout and keep on keepin' on!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","title":"How To Avoid Burnout"},{"content":"My opinions (as a freshman in CS) on how to be an effective and highly coveted software engineer.\nOverview A software engineer can be evaluated based on two factors: their hard skills and their soft skills. I\u0026rsquo;ll be discussing how to maximize each and their relative importance to one another.\nHard Skills A quick indication of a novice developer is their immediate asking of an expert engineer about how many languages or frameworks they know. Not to say that anyone that asks this is an complete beginner, but I want to analyze this trend. Applying my own past as well, I think that most \u0026ldquo;noob\u0026rdquo; developers have this misconception that being proficient in lots of languages and frameworks == skill and prowess as a software engineer. Now, don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, if you can write a web app in React, Angular, and Vue, you\u0026rsquo;ll be much more hireable than most—but you won\u0026rsquo;t be the best. The best engineers that make the highest salaries and create the best products have a baseline understanding of a lot of development technologies—but also incredibly in-depth, master-level knowledge of only a select few.\nA lot of beginners confuse being able to use X technologies with being able to use X technologies in production. For example, I\u0026rsquo;ve a general understanding of Swift. If you asked me to write Hangman in Swift, I could do it. But could I write robust, industry-standard Swift code? Hell no. That\u0026rsquo;s why I don\u0026rsquo;t put Swift on my resume, and if I do, it\u0026rsquo;s under something like a \u0026ldquo;familiar skills\u0026rdquo; sections, with my main technologies being under \u0026ldquo;proficient\u0026rdquo;. The point is that you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t sell yourself as a jack-of-all-trades, but as someone who knows their niche and has shown that through mastery of corresponding technologies (Ex. wanting to be a back-end developer and being a killer Node, Express, and MySQL developer). Companies aren\u0026rsquo;t looking for someone to half-ass a bunch of things, but to kick ass at a select few.\nNow that you\u0026rsquo;ve chosen your technologies, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about how a rockstar developer writes their code. The most apparent difference is how readable the code of a true professional is. I remember sitting at my desk during an internship, reading a PR my boss had made (just for shits and giggles really). Even as an embarrassment of a software engineer, I could tell right away what the purpose of each block of code was. In this way, I sometimes think of writing code as a form of art. There is no perfect solution, it is at times very subjective, but writing truly beautiful code requires an expert craftsman, just like any painting or piece of music. The code of a true rockstar developer is clean, readable, purposeful, malleable (easy to change), and bulletproof. This achieved by eliminating redundancy, never settling for a lack-luster solution, writing code that doesn\u0026rsquo;t require comments, and being very intentional with each decision that is made. Now I know that this is the farthest thing from easy—I know that. But if you can master even half of the things I just listed, you\u0026rsquo;ll be head-and-shoulders above the competition and heavily sought after. If you would like a more in-depth look at how to write clean code, I would recommend reading the Bible on the matter, Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship, written by the legendary \u0026ldquo;Uncle Bob\u0026rdquo;, author of many other award-winning software engineering books.\nSoft Skills Now onto my favorite section: soft skills! A lot of what I\u0026rsquo;m about to discuss is pulled from the hundreds of hours of content I\u0026rsquo;ve listened to from Dave Smith and Jameson Dance, co-hosts of the splendid Soft Skills Engineering Podcast! If you have the time, I would highly recommend checking them out.\nI\u0026rsquo;m gonna forgo any discussion of the more basic soft skills, like time management, critical thinking, and patience, because I think that these just come with time and are less of an immediately learnable skill or related to a change in mindset. That being said, they are still very important, lifelong skills.\nThe first thing I would like to talk about is teamwork. Now I don\u0026rsquo;t mean just working with others that happen to be contributing to the same project as you, but real teamwork. Teamwork that leads to a augmentative joining of many talents, instead of the additive or diminishing kind. Teamwork is a chair that is held up by three things: transparency, mutual respect, and a robust understanding of each team member.\nTransparency is a non-negotiable in any relationship. In terms of software engineering, this manifests in many forms. The three words software engineers hate saying the most are \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\u0026rdquo; But these three words often times could save developers from so much internal turmoil down the line. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know how to do something, don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to say it. Greatness lives in one who triumphs equally over defeat and victory. Transparency with deadlines is also very important. If you hit an unexpected roadblock and you\u0026rsquo;re not going to make your deadline, make that known sooner rather than later. If you need help with your Mocha unit tests, swallow your pride and ask Kathleen for help with your damn Mocha unit tests.\nNow onto mutual respect. Deconstructive competition has no place on a high-functioning team. Put your puny ego aside and work with your teammates, not against them. If they\u0026rsquo;re better than you at something, acknowledge it, and give them the praise they deserve. I love this quote from Dale Carnegie\u0026rsquo;s, How to Win Friends and Influence People. “Any fool can criticize, condemn and complain—and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving.”\nThe third leg on our chair is a wholistic understanding of each member on the team, including yourself. If Sally is a CSS wizard and John is a Golang aficionado, don\u0026rsquo;t take all the CSS and Golang tickets just because you like working on them. And if Jerry isn\u0026rsquo;t the strongest with Express, don\u0026rsquo;t leave him all the Express tickets. Work to each others strengths and be honest about any shortcomings.\nThe next soft skill I would like to discuss is adaptability. This means that just because you\u0026rsquo;re taking an algorithms class in Java or you were hired-on as a MEAN stack web developer, doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that you won\u0026rsquo;t have to write some HTML or refactor a PHP codebase. Become comfortable with being uncomfortable. The best software engineers make the best with what they have and don\u0026rsquo;t complain.\nThe last soft skill I would like to go over is confidence. The number of people who grapple with Imposter Syndrome is insane. There are so many problems with this. It leads to bad code, anxious managers and teammates, and an overall bad experience. People find confidence in a variety of different ways. Some people hone their craft, others are inherently confident. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen people implement a fuck-it mentality where they \u0026ldquo;just suck it up\u0026rdquo; and take up a almost stoic approach to their work. I personally turn to the people around me. If my girlfriend says she thinks my latest and greatest web app is \u0026ldquo;kinda cool ig\u0026rdquo;—then I\u0026rsquo;m on top of the world. As long as the means of production are sustainable (and hopefully ethical), discover your own source of confidence and stick with it.\nHow to Go Above and Beyond Alright, so you\u0026rsquo;ve got all the basics down. You\u0026rsquo;re writing Old-Spice-certified clean code that\u0026rsquo;s not only efficient, but horrifyingly readable and malleable. The team your working on is like a well-oiled machine operating at 7000 RPM like it\u0026rsquo;s nothing. And you\u0026rsquo;re rolling with the punches and adapting to you\u0026rsquo;re environment like a champion. Now what?\nThat\u0026rsquo;s really all there is too it. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t take an Elon Musk or Bill Gates to be a rockstar developer. It\u0026rsquo;s something most people can achieve with the right wisdom and in due time. If you are looking to do more though, you can always trying re-writing your entire codebase in Rust—I\u0026rsquo;ve heard Sr. Engineers love that.\nClosing Thoughts You may be asking, \u0026ldquo;which is more important: soft skills or hard skills?\u0026rdquo;. The answer: an engineer gets hired for their hard skills, but keep their job because of their soft skills.\nFinally, one does not become a rockstar developer, they just start being one. What I mean by this is that most software engineers have the skills and experience necessary to be rockstar developers, they just lack the mindset or wisdom to operate to the best of their abilities. With that, I\u0026rsquo;ll leave you to it. Go kick some software ass and be a hero!\n","permalink":"/posts/how-to-be-a-rockstar-developer/","summary":"\u003c!-- raw HTML omitted --\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eMy opinions (as a freshman in CS) on how to be an effective and highly coveted software engineer.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","title":"How to be a Rockstar Developer (coming from a freshman in college)"},{"content":"A story about why I used to hate myself and what mindset changes I had to implement to stop.\nWhere It All Began You know those shaking platforms you see in games like Mario or Sonic? The ones that fall if you stand on them for too long. Well, for the longest time, I felt like my whole life was resting on a never-ending series of these.\nIt all started when I was 15. I won\u0026rsquo;t go into it too much, but when my grandmother passed away, it shook me at my core. I realized that from that point on, I wanted to make something of my life and be someone that the people in my life could be proud of. But I felt as if I was **behind—that everyone else had a multi-year head start on me and that I had to catch up. So, obviously, I tried to maximize every second of every day. I would either code, read, or go to work whenever I wasn\u0026rsquo;t at school. I tried to cut out all distractions and put all my efforts into productivity—but it was never good enough. Having gone to a very competitive school, I was constantly comparing myself to some of the top students in the nation, not just academically, but in every avenue of life. I would constantly ask myself why I wasn\u0026rsquo;t as good at coding as Friend A or as good at speaking as Classmate B. And with stoicism as my justification, I viewed a difference in circumstances as \u0026ldquo;a measly excuse\u0026rdquo;, placing all the blame on my alleged lack of hard work or ability.\nThis toxic mentality manifested into cycles of hyper-productivity, burnout, and self-hatred. This would look like me coding after school every day for a week, then getting burned out and watching anime all day, and finally hating myself for \u0026ldquo;falling into depravity\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;wasting precious time\u0026rdquo;, forcing myself to be productive again. I remember just feeling like such shit all the time and not knowing why. It took so many night of staring at the ceiling and talking to myself to realize that I was just so dissatisfied with myself. I would stare at myself in the mirror every morning and call myself a failure, and a loser, and point out every single thing I hated about myself (there were a lot). This led to me having no confidence, motivation, or any positive emotions whatsoever throughout the day. I felt like an empty shell that was just floating with the current, that nothing I could do would change anything. I spent all my days sitting in my room, not wanting to do anything productive and hating myself for it.\nHow I Flipped The Switch I don\u0026rsquo;t remember what led up to it, but one day, I was sitting in my friend\u0026rsquo;s room, talking to her about all of discontent and hatred I had for myself. She was baffled. She had no idea how a logical personal in my shoes could think like that. She asked me if I was genuinely unhappy with the person I had become, and of course my response was, \u0026ldquo;yes.\u0026rdquo; She asked me if I wasn\u0026rsquo;t proud of all the work experience I had accumulated at such a young age, of the numerous projects I was able to create with purely self-taught knowledge, or all the time I had spent reading and researching ways to improve myself. My response was something along the lines of a half-assed, \u0026ldquo;I mean I guess those were cool, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t exactly work hard for any of that\u0026rdquo;—I didn\u0026rsquo;t give myself an ounce of credit. I then explained to her that my outlook on my life had been one of \u0026ldquo;going from horse-shit to dog-shit\u0026rdquo;, and that all the work I had put in was to turn a pitiful excuse for a person into a measly one. She then went on to throw both of her shoes at me. She (through much difficulty) explained to me that I was fine as I was, and that I should look at anything extra I do as \u0026ldquo;going above and beyond\u0026rdquo;. She told me to change my outlook to \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m good now, and everything I\u0026rsquo;m doing is to make me great later.\u0026rdquo; Much better than the \u0026ldquo;horse-shit dog-shit\u0026rdquo; nonsense I was spewing before.\nI walked out of that room, for the first time in so long, content with myself. I was satisfied and happy with the progress I had made and the person I had become. I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel the aggressive need to better myself at every possible avenue. I felt like from that point on I was growing out of choice and ambition, not obligation. To this day, I still remember the sensation of a weight being lifted from my shoulders when I was told that the ground was not this shaking platform, but a solid foundation that I needn\u0026rsquo;t worry about collapsing.\nSince that day, I\u0026rsquo;ve further solidified my new mentality into the following principles. I\u0026rsquo;m fine as I am, and that anything that I do outside of what\u0026rsquo;s required of me is a cherry on top. I\u0026rsquo;ve done well to get where I am today and that even if I stopped trying all together right now, I\u0026rsquo;ll still lead a comfortable life in the future (CS bag let\u0026rsquo;s go). Don\u0026rsquo;t be dragged forward by obligation, but instead driven forward by ambition. And finally, some seconds are worth more than others—cherish and maximize the seconds that are the most important.\nClosing I hope you found my story interesting or relatable and if the latter, then I hope you were able to find something to apply to your own life. If there is only one thing you take away from this post, I would want it to be this: \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t be dragged forward by obligation, be driven forward by ambition.\u0026quot; With that, I hope you have an amazing day and I hope to see you in the next post!\n","permalink":"/posts/why-i-hated-myself/","summary":"\u003c!-- raw HTML omitted --\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eA story about why I used to hate myself and what mindset changes I had to implement to stop.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Why I Hated Myself and How I Stopped"}]
