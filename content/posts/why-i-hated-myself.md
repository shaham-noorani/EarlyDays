# Where It All Began
You know those shaking platforms you see in games like Mario or Sonic? The ones that fall if you stand on them for too long. Well, for the longest time, I felt like my whole life was resting on a never-ending series of these. 

It all started when I was 15. I won't go into it too much, but when my grandmother passed away, it shook me at my core. I realized that from that point on, I wanted to make something of my life and be someone that the people in my life could be proud of. But I felt as if I was behind—that everyone else had a multi-year head start on me and that I had to catch up. So, obviously, I tried to maximize every second of every day. I would either code, read, or go to work whenever I wasn't at school. I tried to cut out all distractions and put all my efforts into productivity—but it was never good enough. Having gone to a very competitive school, I was constantly comparing myself to some of the top students in the nation, not just academically, but in every avenue of life. I would constantly ask myself why I wasn't as good at coding as Friend A or as good at speaking as Classmate B. And with "stoicism" as my justification, I viewed a difference in circumstances as "a measly excuse", placing all the blame on my alleged lack of hard work or ability. 

This toxic mentality manifested into cycles of hyper-productivity, burnout, and self-hatred. This would look like me coding after school every day for a week, then getting burned out and watching anime all day, and finally hating myself for "falling into depravity" and "wasting precious time", forcing myself to be productive again. I remember just feeling like such shit all the time and not knowing why. It took so many night of staring at the ceiling and talking to myself to realize that **I was just so dissatisfied with myself**. I would stare at myself in the mirror every morning and call myself a *failure*, and a *loser*, and point out every single thing I hated about myself (there were a lot). This led to me having no confidence, motivation, or any positive emotions whatsoever throughout the day. I felt like an empty shell that was just floating with the current, that nothing I could do would change anything. I spent all my days sitting in my room, not wanting to do anything productive and hating myself for it. 

# How I Flipped The Switch

I don't remember what led up to it, but one day, I was sitting in my friend's room, talking to her about all of discontent and hatred I had for myself. She was baffled. She had no idea how a logical personal in my shoes could think like that. She asked me if I was genuinely unhappy with the person I had become, and of course my response was, "yes." She asked me if I wasn't proud of all the work experience I had accumulated at such a young age, of the numerous projects I was able to create with purely self-taught knowledge, or all the time I had spent reading and researching ways to improve myself. My response was something along the lines of a half-assed, "I mean I guess those were cool, but I didn't exactly work hard for any of that"—I didn't give myself an ounce of credit. I then explained to her that my outlook on my life had been one of "going from horse-shit to dog-shit", and that all the work I had put in was to turn a pitiful excuse for a person into a measly excuse for one. She then went on to throw both of her shoes at me. She (through *much* difficulty) explained to me that I was fine as I was, and that I should look at anything extra I do as "going above and beyond". She told me to change my outlook to "I'm good now, and everything I'm doing is to make me great later." Much better than the "horse-shit dog-shit nonsense" I was spewing before. 

I walked out of that room, for the first time in *so long*, content with myself. I was satisfied and *happy* with the progress I had made and the person I had become. I didn't feel the aggressive need to better myself at every possible avenue. I felt like from that point on I was growing out of choice and ambition, not **obligation**. To this day, I still remember the sensation of a weight being lifted from my shoulders when I was told that the ground was not this shaking platform, but a solid foundation that I needn't worry about collapsing.

Since that day, I've further solidified my new mentality into the following principles. I'm fine as I am, and that anything that I do outside of what's required of me is a cherry on top. I've done well to get where I am today and that even if I stopped trying all together right now, I'll still lead a comfortable life in the future (CS bag let's go). Don't be dragged forward by obligation, but instead driven forward by ambition. Some seconds are worth more than others—cherish and maximize the seconds that are the most important. 

# Closing

I hope you found my story interesting or relatable and if the latter, then I hope you were able to find something to apply to your own life. If there is only one thing you take away from this post, I would want it to be this: **"Don't be dragged forward by obligation, be driven forward by ambition."** With that, I hope you have an amazing day and I hope to see you in the next post!
