# The Status Quo

Your first day as a college student is the first day you're no longer allowed to not know what you want to do with your life. Your decision must not only be made, but set in stone, and if it's not: it'll be made for you. Of course, you can always change your major or drop out of college, but if your parents aren't white I wouldn't recommend going back home afterwards. The whole system is so stupid. You're forced to make a life-altering decision based on maybe 10 years of experience in the world. The school system does a horrible job of helping you find a career path. Everyone shit talks you if you do something as crazy as *changing your mind.* And if take a gap-year to find your passion before going to college, you're seen as lesser than those who don't. The system celebrates those who make quick and tradition decisions and punishes those who don't want to brazenly put all their eggs into one basket. Even after college, if you want to work somewhere your degree isn't very applicable then good luckâ€”because a degree in gender-studies is barely better than no degree at all. 

Of course, not everyone thinks this. Some colleges force students to be undecided or general studies their first year so that they're not stuck in a 4-year program they hate. Some companies hire people based on who they are, not the words on a piece of paper. Some people preach that you should drop out of college and do what you love: like make jam. I definitely think that people are moving away from the tradition mindset on the topic, but it's still very prevalent. As such, I would like to express the merits and demerits of creating a long term plan, putting all your eggs into on basket, and searching for your calling in life with celerity.

# Optimism vs Realism

There are two types of people, those who prefer to look at things with optimism because it makes them happier, and those who look at things with skepticism because they're afraid of being disappointed, wasting their time, or being hurt. However, most people know that being optimistic usually leads to a happier and most successful life. So how can we apply this to the idea of having long term plans? Well, I want you, right now, to think about the ideal future. It can be 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, or 43 minutes and 18 seconds into the future. Think about what you would do on a perfect day. Think about the things that you would have, the things you would have experienced, and everything you would have accomplished up until that point. Be optimistic. Even if the chance of you passing college is below 2.3%, just imagine that you have that Supreme T-shirt anyway.
