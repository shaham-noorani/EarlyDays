# If You've Never Read the Book

Then go and read it. I'm not going to sit here and tell you that I can convey the messages from the book better than Dale Carnegie himself. Now that (hopefully), I know that you've read the book, let's continue.


# Overview

No book has had more of a grand or lasting impact on how I go about my everyday life than the absolute classic that is *How to Win Friends and Influence People*. I consider it the **bible** on social interaction and mentality when it comes to interpersonal communication. I've re-read the books multiples times and implement lessons taught it in almost daily. I attribute the majority of the success (haha) when communicating to what I learned by reading this book.
