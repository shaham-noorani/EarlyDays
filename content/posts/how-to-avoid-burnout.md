# My Experience with Burnout

In the field of software engineering, being able to learn quickly and keep up with the latest changes in technology is a huge part of the job. Even if you stay at the same company, the opportunity cost of not switching to the latest-and-greatest new technology is massive and never goes away. This is why I've constantly dabbling with the latest frameworks and tools. But just because it's expected of every engineer, doesn't mean it's easy. Going out of your comfort zone and trying completely new things is challenging and takes lots of time and patience. 

I recently tried to deploy an older project of mine with Google Cloud. It's a Vue SPA with a separate Express + MySQL backend. Although this wasn't my first time deploying to GC App Engine, it was my first time doing so with something so complicated. I had also never used Docker before so I was in for a world of hurt. Not to say that a par-level SWE couldn't knock this out in a day or two, but at my level of experience it was a challenge and a half. 

My first approach was to lookup how to deploy my exact stack and copy all the `code blocks` on whatever tutorial popped up first on Google. No way this goes tits up, right? 

So obviously that didn't work. Having gone through about a dozen YouTube and Medium Tutorials, it was time for Plan B. This involved looking for higher quality tutorials (more recent, clearer instructions, etc. ) even if the stack wasn't exactly the same. But even after a dozen more tutorials, still no luck. At this point I was around 10 hours in and had nothing to show for it. Once I realized this, I gave up.

This same thing has happened to me many other times. Once, I was trying to make a sort of "quality of life" chatbot that would help me keep track of homework and assignments. At the time I was 16 and didn't understand what NLP was. Needless to say I was way in over my head and gave up two weeks later. 

Another instance of burnout I had was in the gym. I had just signed my 12 month gym membership and was ready to go. As a sort of "test run", I decided to go on my own one day with the intentions of exercising my "arms." I walked around to every machine, looked at the target muscle group inscribed on each, and gave one a shot of it involved a muscle near my arms (at the time I thought this just meant bi's and tri's). After mindlessly wandering around for an hour and quitting each machine after 5 or 10 reps, I left defeated and embarrassed.  

# Why Burnout Occurs

With a quick Google search, you can find this definition:

> Burnout is a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by excessive and prolonged stress. It occurs when you feel overwhelmed, emotionally drained, and unable to meet constant demands.

So in layman's terms, "burnout" occurs when the going gets **unbearably** tough and our body/mind can't keep up. In my case, this occurred from me metaphorically slamming my head against a wall and then eventually passion out from blood loss. I like this metaphor because it highlights what I think are the two main causes of burnout: lack of instant gratification and constant overexertion. When you make love to a wall with your forehead in a woodpecker-esque manor, not only is there no sign of progress (save the blood dripping from your head), but the amount of work (not the physics kind) you're putting in is not sustainable for a long period of time. 

# My 3 Ways of Avoiding Burnout

Okay, so I've given you a couple examples of burnout in my life and described what I think are the two main causes, but how can we avoid burnout in our everyday lives? Before I offer my 3 ways of avoiding burnout, I want to disclaim that these are what have worked for me and that I do not have a certain piece of paper crediting everything that comes out of my mouth (figuratively) with respect to Psychology. With that in mind, let's get right into it. 

## Maintaining Flow State

> In positive psychology, a flow state, also known colloquially as being in the zone, is the mental state in which a person performing some activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity.

Sounds awesome, right? Right. In my mind, being in a flow state is the polar opposite of feeling burnt out. Instead of feeling like the task you're working on is draining you, it actually gives you the energy to keep going ad infinitum. But how do we get into this goldilocks state of mind? Well, just like the story with the three bears, we need to find something just right. The leading theory in achieving and maintaining flow-state is to reach a balance between challenge and skill in whatever you're doing. This means that just like in the optimal lift in the gym, you do your best work when your skill for something and
