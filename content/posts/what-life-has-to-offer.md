Just some food for thought.

# You

If you're reading this, you're probably in college. You've most likely got a general idea about what career path you want to pursue. You've kinda figured out what type of stuff you think is cool. Maybe you've got some hobbies. Hopefully you have some people who you can call great friends. You may have dabbled with love in the past, or may be doing so in the present. You've probably hit rock bottom, and there's definitely been a time where you felt on top of the world! You probably know exactly where your cell phone is and I know you could tell me the first name of **\_\_** Swift.

But do you know what you value in life? Are you aware of your non-negotiables: the things that no amount of money could take away from you? Have you taken a big risk in the past couple of weeks, months, or ever? When was the last time you failed miserably and laughed about it? Honestly, when was the last time you failed miserably at all? Like a genuine failure with real, long-term ramifications? When was the last time you cried tears of joy? When was the last time you looked around and really thought to yourself, "wow, life is cool."

We are all so focused on "winning" the game of society: attaining wealth, career success, great grades, looking cool, making those around us proud? Why does **any** of that matter?

Are we not humans within this incredible circumstance we call life? Should we not live enjoy it for everything it has to offer? Who cares if no one thinks your hobbies are cool? Who cares if you could be making 300k in silicon valley? Who would you rather be at lunch with: a senior consultant at McKinsey, or an amateur comedian? Who would you rather be?

# Me

For most of my life, I've chased two things: a great salary and a woman that I want to marry. And you know what, I've pretty much secured both of those things. So now what? What is there left in life? According to societyâ€”I've made it! Yay...right?

Actually, now I'm supposed to make a shit ton of money, and then go have kids and donate a ton of time and money to non-profits, right? I should try to be that guy with a sports coat that hosts the best gatherings and that everyone thinks is cool. Then I've made it, right?

But I don't want to be that guy. I'd rather be Shaham, that guy with the cute wife that has a house that smells like cinnamon and the most adorable kids. I'd rather be a great listener and an empathetic friend.

# What I Want

I read in a book once that you should always speak in terms of the other person's interests, so writing about myself here is directly opposite of that. But I hope that by reading this next section, you might reassess your life just a little bit.

These days, I spend a lot of time thinking about what I want in life. I've always known that I wanted to settle down and have kids, but what about until then?

I've been extremely lucky in two specific ways. The first would be in terms of meeting the woman of my dreams. She makes me so immensely happy by just being around her and I would never be the man I am today if it wasn't for her. The second is in the people that I've found around myself. I recently joined a student organization on campus, and some of the conversations I've had with the people in it have been just amazing.

Finally, I always think back to my time as a summer camp counselor or my part-time job as a coding instructor for children, or my work at a charity software company. When I do think back to these times in my life, I'm rushed with such a sense of fulfillment and purpose time and time again. Nothing in my life has been more satisfying than the work I've done for betterment of others.
