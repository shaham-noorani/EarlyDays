# Humble Beginnings

I like to think that my life truly began when I came to **Austin, TX** in the 6th grade. It was such a big chance from what I had been to used to, living my whole life prior in the South-East. My middle school experience wasn't very memorable, with the main higlights including lots of video games played and my involvement in the production of my 7th and 8th grade yearbooks. 

However, it was during this mundane middle school experience that I was introduced to the world of software. Starting off with a simple, frontend graphics library called Processing.js that I was taught in my *tech-systems class*, I became infatuated with coding. The remainder of my eight grade from that point on was filled with many sleepless nights spent coding games in Pygame (they're still on my [GitHub](https://github.com/shaham-noorani) if you're interested). 

My freshman year I signup for **AP Computer Science**, an intro to computer science class taught in Java. With my previous coding experience (Pygame and Processing.js, *insane I know*), I breezed through the class and got a fi—three on the AP Exam... Don't worry I re-took it the next year and got that five. Speaking of the next year: over the Spring break of my sophomore year, I attened my first hackathon. And guess what was the first-place prize: an internship at a local cybersecurity startup. And guess who's team got first place: not mine! However, through some *persistence* and persuasion, I convinced the CEO of the startup to pity-grant me an internship postition at his company. 

Now this may not have been my dream "software engineering internship": jam packed with writing production code and working with a professional dev team; but it was definetley a turing point in my life. It was during this summer that I finally realized that coding could be a proffession, and that I wanted everything to do with it.

Nearing the end of this internship, I was spending some time in downtown Austin when rain started coming down from nowhere. Seeking shelter, I hurried to a nearby event center. As I walked in through the 30 ft tall doors, I saw a man in a blue polo reading a book, sitting behind a sort of registration area. I asked him what he was doing and his response was, "well, I work for a company called Auction Source and we're helping XYZ orginzation run this event today." Being the incredibly bold 16 year-old I was at the time, I asked if they were hiring. Not if they were hiring software engineers, or part-timers, or interns: just if they were hiring. But just as luck would have it, there comes swooping in the VP of the company, bringing with him a, "hell yeah we are!"

After a pair of phone interviews and one of the in-person variety, I was hired on a part-time/contractor basis as a "technician." My job was to arrive at a customer's (most often a charity organization) event with a boat load of MacBooks and iPads in tow, setup a registration area, and teach their staff/volunteers how to use our platform. Then throughout the night, my role was more of damage control—meaning that on a perfect night I would barely move a muscle until the end of the night. Thankfully, there were no "perfect nights."

A little something about is that I am not the most—you know—"academically driven" indiviudal. I wouldn't do homework if I thought it was pointless, I wouldn't study for a quiz or test if I didn't find the topics interesting. My typical day in high school would comprise of waking up late, driving 40 minutes to school (I lived outside of the district), showing up tardy to first period, messing around with my friends or coding whenever I could do so without being scolded (most of the time), and then leaving an hour or two early to go to work. If I didn't have work that day then I would drive 40 minutes back home through traffic, code until around dinner time, go to the gym with my buddies, and then come home and code until 2 or 3 in the morning. Just in-case you missed it, "study" or "do homework" weren't anywhere to be found in this daily routine.
