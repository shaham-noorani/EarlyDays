# Humble Beginnings

I like to think that my life truly began when I came to **Austin, TX** in the 6th grade. It was such a big chance from what I had been to used to, living my whole life prior in the South-East. My middle school experience wasn't very memorable, with the main higlights including lots of video games played and my involvement in the production of my 7th and 8th grade yearbooks. 

However, it was during this mundane middle school experience that I was introduced to the world of software. Starting off with a simple, frontend graphics library called Processing.js that I was taught in my *tech-systems class*, I became infatuated with coding. The remainder of my eight grade from that point on was filled with many sleepless nights spent coding games in Pygame (they're still on my [GitHub](https://github.com/shaham-noorani) if you're interested). 

My freshman year I sign up for **AP Computer Science**, an intro to computer science class taught in Java. With my previous coding experience (Pygame and Processing.js, *insane I know*), I breezed through the class and got a fi—three on the AP Exam... Don't worry I re-took it the next year and got that five. Speaking of the next year: over the Spring break of my sophomore year, I attened my first hackathon. And guess what was the first-place prize: an internship at a local cybersecurity startup. And guess who's team got first place: not mine! However, through some *persistence* and persuasion, I convinced the CEO of the startup to pity-grant me an internship postition at his company. 

Now this may not have been my dream "software engineering internship": jam packed with writing production code and working with a professional dev team; but it was definetley a turing point in my life. It was during this summer that I finally realized that coding could be a proffession, and that I wanted everything to do with it.

Nearing the end of this internship, I was spending some time in downtown Austin when rain started coming down from nowhere. Seeking shelter, I hurried to a nearby event center. As I walked in through the 30 ft tall doors, I saw a man in a blue polo reading a book, sitting behind a table with a sign that read "Check-in". I asked him what he was doing and his response was, "well, I work for a company called Auction Source and we're helping XYZ orginzation run this event today." Being the incredibly bold 16 year-old I was at the time, I asked if they were hiring. Not if they were hiring software engineers, or part-timers, or interns: just if they were hiring. But just as luck would have it, there comes swooping in the VP of the company, bringing with him a, "hell yeah we are!"

After a pair of phone interviews and one of the in-person variety, I was hired on a part-time/contractor basis as a "technician." My job was to arrive at a customer's (most often a charity organization) event with a boat load of MacBooks and iPads in tow, setup a registration area, and teach their staff/volunteers how to use our platform. Then throughout the night, my role was more of damage control—meaning that on a perfect night I would barely move a muscle until the end of the night. Thankfully, there were no "perfect nights."

A little something about is that I am not the most—you know—"academically driven" indiviudal. I wouldn't do homework if I thought it was pointless, I wouldn't study for a quiz or test if I didn't find the topics interesting. My typical day in high school would comprise of waking up late, driving 40 minutes to school (I lived outside of the district), showing up tardy to first period, messing around with my friends or coding whenever I could do so without being scolded (most of the time), and then leaving an hour or two early to go to work. If I didn't have work that day then I would drive 40 minutes back home through traffic, code until around dinner time, go to the gym with my buddies, and then come home and code until 2 or 3 in the morning. Just in-case you missed it, "study" or "do homework" weren't anywhere to be found in this daily routine.

At this part of my journey, I've: interned at a software company, been working part-time for about 9 months at another, taken 2 CS classes, and worked on a few personal projects; but I knew it was time for the big leagues. One weekend, a local high school had come to us asking for our services for their upcoming annual fundraiser. I call dibs and later that week I drive up to the venue for the event. The job starts off pretty standard: set up the check-in area, train the volunteers, etc. A couple hours into the night, once the majority of the constituents, I'm bidind my time until the end of the night when a man in his mid-forties asks me about the platform and what technologies it uses. Like the genius I am, I told him it was a "Java front-end and Angluar backend." For those of who are less developer-savy, that's the equivalent of me saying "my desk is made of steel and my laptop: wood." After quite the strong start though, we sit down and have a conversation. He tells me that he works for a local healthcare-software company. Near the end of the conversation, I ask him if the company hired sofware engineer interns. After sizing me up for a second, he makes the mista—I mean he tells me that they indeed do and gave me the email of their "College Talent Recruiter". 

After a couple of months and a phone interview, I'm invited to the office for a *Technical Interview*. So, in usual fashion, I leave school early and show-up to their office with hutzpah and vigor. There were two interviewers: the first was a Sr. Software Architect and the other was the Head of QA. The first part of the interview was pretty basic: tell us about yourself, walk us through some of your projects, etc. Now onto the second part, the coding question: Write a binary search tree algorithm. Literally 4 hours before, my high school CS teacher, when asked about how to prepare for a technical interview, told me that the most common question asked either was about, or involved, a binary search tree. So, like any reasonable person, I studied them the day before the interview. However, I had one small shortcoming: I didn't know that all the studying in the world would be rendered useless if you blank the day of. 

So after bombing the technical portion of the interview, the two interviewers sat me down and told me that they really liked and that because of logistical reasons, they're not able to tell me that I got the position that very moment. So, 2 months later, I got an email congratulating me on landing the position along with a DocuSign contract for a 12-week, $20/hr internship. I would be starting at the end of May as an intern on the QA team. After telling every single person I knew and spending every hour between then and May learning Maven, JUnit, and Selenium WebDriver, I was ready for the big leagues. 

Alright, it's the big day, the first day of my big boy software engineering internship. After getting settled and meeting everyone, I was given my first assignment: refactor the QA codebase. Now, I want to preface that at this point in time, I didn't even know what the word refactor meant, what the importance of clean code was, or anything other than fundamental computer science constructs and basic back-end development. So the first thing I asked after seeing an absolute mess of a codebase was, "What's wrong with it? Looks fine to me." So the head of QA sat me down and described to me why this codebase was an intertangled monstrosity of a repository and needed heavy cleaning. Essentially, the codebase comprised of one repository containing every single integration tests written for all 4 of the companies products. They were all under the same Maven project, had no versioning system, had minimal CI, and was impossible to work on unless you knew exactly what you were doing.
