## Humble Beginnings

I like to think that my life truly began when I came to **Austin, TX** in the 6th grade. It was such a big chance from what I had been to used to, living my whole life prior in the South-East. My middle school experience wasn't very memorable, with the main higlights including lots of video games played and my involvement in the production of my 7th and 8th grade yearbooks. 

However, it was during this mundane middle school experience that I was introduced to the world of software. Starting off with a simple, frontend graphics library called Processing.js that I was taught in my *tech-systems class*, I became infatuated with coding. The remainder of my eight grade from that point on was filled with many sleepless nights spent coding games in Pygame (they're still on my [GitHub](https://github.com/shaham-noorani) if you're interested). 

My freshman year I signup for **AP Computer Science**, an intro to computer science class taught in Java. With my previous coding experience (Pygame and Processing.js, *insane I know*), I breezed through the class and got a fiâ€”three on the AP Exam... Don't worry I re-took it the next year and got a five. Speaking of the next year: over the Spring break of my sophomore year, I attened my first hackathon. And guess what was the first-place prize: an internship at a local cybersecurity startup. And guess who's team got first place: not mine! However, through some *persistence* and persuasion, I convinced the CEO of the startup to pity-grant me an internship postition at his company. 

Now this may not have been my dream "software engineering internship", jam packed with writing production code and working with a professional dev team, but it was definetley a turing point in my life.
