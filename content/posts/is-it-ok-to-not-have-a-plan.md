# The Status Quo

Your first day as a college student is the first day you're no longer allowed to not know what you want to do with your life. Your decision must not only be made, but set in stone, and if it's not: it'll be made for you. Of course, you can always change your major or drop out of college, but if your parents aren't white I wouldn't recommend going back home afterwards. The whole system is so stupid. You're forced to make a life-altering decision based on maybe 10 years of real experience in the world. The school system does a horrible job of helping you find a career path. Everyone shit talks you if you do something as crazy as *changing your mind.* And if you take a gap-year to find your passion before going to college, you're seen as lesser than those who don't. The system celebrates those who make quick and tradition decisions and punishes those who don't want to brazenly put all their eggs into one basket. Even after college, if you want to work somewhere your degree isn't very applicable then good luck—because a degree in gender-studies is barely better than no degree at all. 

Of course, not everyone thinks this. Some colleges force students to be undecided or general studies their first year so that they're not stuck in a 4-year program they hate. Some companies hire people based on who they are, not the words on a piece of paper. Some people preach that you should drop out of college and do what you love: like make jam. I definitely think that people are moving away from the tradition mindset on the topic, but it's still very prevalent. As such, I would like to express the merits and demerits of creating a long term plan, putting all your eggs into on basket, and searching for your calling in life with celerity.

# Optimism vs Realism

There are two types of people, those who prefer to look at things with optimism because it makes them happier, and those who look at things with skepticism because they're afraid of being disappointed, wasting their time, or being hurt. However, most people know that being optimistic usually leads to a happier and most successful life. So how can we apply this to the idea of having long term plans? Well, I want you, right now, to think about the ideal future. It can be 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, or 43 minutes and 18 seconds into the future. Think about what you would do on a perfect day. Think about the things that you would have, the things you would have experienced, and everything you would have accomplished up until that point. Be optimistic. Even if the chance of you passing college is below 2.3%, just imagine that you have that Supreme T-shirt anyway. Just immerse yourself in that ideal future and live in it.

Now, I know it's a pain, but grab a pencil, and write down 12 things you see. Half of them, for our purposes, should be related to passion or a career, and the remaining 6 should be about who you are and what the people around you are like. There are many things that you can do with this, but for today, just do me a favor and be optimistic that you can be there one day. 

# Knowing What You Want in Life

I have no idea what I want in life. There, I said it. That was scary. I don't like saying that out loud—but it needed to be said. I think that I want to work on education in the future, maybe doing something with computers, possibly write book and become a speaker on the topic of productivity and other life-coaching topics. But if I was a betting man, I wouldn't put a dollar on any of those things coming true.

Relating to the last section, it's not that I'm being pessimistic, I'm just very aware of the sporadic nature of life. Life is a fucking whirlpool and we're on a paper boat with only a straw to us as an oar. But as long as we have hope, we will ride the waves like a fucking 6' 8" viking!!! This is why I focus less on simply working on job-specific skills, but instead becoming an effective all-rounded person so that once I do find my passion, staring me down like that last pair of ripped black jeans on clearance that fit me perfectly, I will be enough of a man to grab it by the balls before someone else does. 

So it's okay to not know what you want in life. It, however, is not okay to stop looking and stop improving yourself (imo ofc).


# Looking Ahead

So, a friend of mine got me this book recently. It's called *The Art of Impossible: A Peak Performance Primer* by Steven Kotler. The book tries to create a formula for doing things that people used to consider impossible like turning a book store into a multi-billion dollar business or surfing on a wave of over 60 feet. The first section of the books goes over how to find that next "impossible" thing that's meant for you (aka find your passion). I have not finished the book yet, but once I do, I'll share my findings!

# Conclusion

So in conclusion, the system sucks. Don't let anyone tell you where and when you have to have your life figured out. At the end the day, your happiness is the number one priority. But, if you are actively searching for that passion, just take it slow, taste everything life has to offer, explore the world and yourself, and enjoy the process! Life will reward you, I **promise**!

Then, till next time, keep it fresh! I can't wait to read about you in the news!
