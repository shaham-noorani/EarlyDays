*In the traditional model of success for engineers, we’re pushed to find a field that we have a blend of aptitude and passion for, and to become **specialists** in it. But as the problems we face as engineers become more complex and challenging, we need to shift our pursuits. Instead of specialists that have devoted their entire lives to one craft, the engineers that succeed in our current world are **generalists** that seek something very different: a diverse set of skills and expertise, something called **range**.*

# An Engineer That Does X

Most engineers call themselves an "X Engineer" because it describes **what they do**. However, as aspiring engineers, I believe we should strive not to be an "X Engineer", but instead, an "**Engineer That Does X**". Though both titles share the same meaning, the mindsets are a complete dichotomy. By focusing first on becoming an **engineer**, and then picking a discipline, we're allowed to pursue skills that specialists would often overlook: things like core engineering and professional soft skills. 

There's a popular mantra that states, "you get hired for your hard skills, but keep your job and get promoted for you soft skills." Most discipline-specific hard-skills can be learned relatively quickly, but fundamental engineering skills, and even more so vocational soft skills, take years to master. This is why it is crucial to start working towards mastering these early on.

It is also important to remember that these are the **only** skills that stay with you as you change positions in your career. For a list of important general skills for engineers, you can visit the first [link](https://google.com) at the end of this post. 

# College Should Be a Time To Explore

There are many things you should not rush into, and you career is most certainly one of them. As college students, we're presented with many opportunities, but I believe the greatest of them all is the opportunity to explore. Just like how you get way too many samples before choosing a flavor at the ice cream parlor, I believe this is how we should approach choosing an engineering discipline. Not just looking up the facts and figures, but actually "tasting" (or experiencing) each one. I know that this can seem incredibly cumbersome and daunting, but I've got a dual-faceted response. 

First is a question: would you rather spend another 4 years pursuing an exciting new career, or 40 years engaging in a lackluster one? The second is a story. For those of you who don't watch grown men strike rubber balls with metal stick, in the world of tennis, most revere Roger Federer as the Greatest of All Time. However, foreign to our innate biases of the benefits of early specialization, Roger played many sports since he was 8, and only started focusing solely on tennis many years later. This pattern had occurred in many other great athletes, such as Steph Curry and LeBron James. 

By trying a lot of things, we more likely to choose a more fitting career **and** kick ass at it. Some mediums for exploring engineering disciplines include: sitting in on classes, having a coffee chat with those that practice it, joining related clubs, starting pet projects, and then on the more commitment-heavy side of the spectrum, pursuing a co-op or internship or a minor. The idea is to pursue a great enough level of depth to get the whole experience without considerably hindering your ability to pivot to another field. 

# Main Takeaways

I believe that to become a red-ass engineer, you should create a very strong foundation of general skills, go knee-deep into a variety of different engineering disciplines while you have the time to explore, and fight the fear of taking a career risk and "having to starting over", because every step of the way, you're developing most quintessential asset—range.
