*Some advice, as well as my game plan for landing an internship for next summer!*

# What do you want?

A smart man once said, "start with the end in mind." In our current context, this means that you need to ask yourself, "what do I want" before you read the rest of this article. Read all of the questions below, and really take a second to think over your answers. If you don't have an answer in mind, that's okay: but you need to know that now. Here are the questions: (I would highly recommend writing down your answers)

- Why do you want an internship? Is it the resume pad? Is it the experience? Is it the money? Is it to secure a position at a certain company in the future? Is it the flex? Is it a combination of a bunch of factors? If so, in what order do they rank? 

- What fields/industries would you enjoy interning in? Remember, you can apply to internships outside of your major. 

- How much time are you willing to spend to get an internship? Is this an amount of time you would be okay with spending even if you end up with 0 offers? What's your backup plan? 

- An internship means that you will (most likely) be working full-time over the one season where you're not required to take classes. Are you sure you're willing to give up your precious summer?

Now that you've really thought about these things, and you're confident an internship is what you want, let's begin. 

# LinkedIn

And what better place to begin than the world's most popular professional networking platform. If you haven't yet made an account, I would highly encourage you to do so. LinkedIn allows you to keep in touch with your network so that if the occasion may arise where you're looking for a job (or more specifically an internship), you can reach them all within as little as one post. 

If you already have an account, but you don't think you've connected with everyone in your network (this includes, family, friends, classmates, past coworkers/bosses, and random people you've met on the street), this should be your first priority. Even if they're the same age as you, or younger, these connections may still be able to help you along your internship hunt. And don't be shy! Adding someone on LinkedIn should never be an embarrassing action. 

Now that your connections tab is fully saturated, it's time to get to work. Start by scrolling through your connections, and if they've worked at or are currently working at a company that you're interested, send them a message. You can ask them about their experience, about what the interview process is like, ask them for their recruiter's email, or if you're still close with them, ask them if they've got time to grab coffee. In person meetings are always the most effective. 

If you do a good job at this, you should end up with a lot more information, and if you're lucky, some recruiters' emails. With this, you should be well equipped to continue to the next section of this post. 

# It's a Numbers Game

Here are some numbers to consider. If I apply to 100 software engineering internships across the US, I would expect to get 10-15 interviews, and maybe 2-4 offers. Indeed.com also says that "you should apply to 10 to 20 internships every two to three weeks." Obviously this can vary **a ton**. Depending on the field, your class status, past work experienceâ€”you get the picture. But these numbers are a good ballpark of what you can expect. 

So what does this mean? This means that you need to apply to a ton of internship positions. As many as you can. Think of it like dating, but if for some reason talking to a lot of the opposite gender at once wasn't frowned upon.
